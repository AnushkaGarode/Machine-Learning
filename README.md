### Project 1: Match Score Prediction using Linear Regression
In this Project I take a dataset of Cricket Score from Cricinfo Website.The Dataset contains two attribute first attribute is Overs which is called X and Second attribute is Score which is called Y and dataset contain 20 instances mean 20 overs dataset and I Use a Simple Linear Regression Algorithm to predict the Score of 20th overs using the Scikit Learn Library.Basically I use 80% data for training and 20% for Testing Base on Testing I make a prediction of Score.

### Project 2: Heart Rate of Rabbits Prediction using Decision Tree Regression
In this Project I take a dataset of Heart rate baroreflexes for rabbits from Reddit Website.The dataset contains measurements of mean arterial pressure (mmHG) and heart rate (b/min) for a baroreflex curve.A data frame with 18 observations on the following 2 variables.first attribute is 'pressure' a numeric vector containing measurements of arterial pressure.Second Attribute is 'rate'a numeric vector containing measurements of heart rate. I Use a Decision Tree Regression Algorithm to predict the Hear Rate of Rabbits using the Scikit Learn Library.Basically I use 80% data for training and 20% for Testing Base on Testing I make a prediction of Heart Rate of Rabbits.
