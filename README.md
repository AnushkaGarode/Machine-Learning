# Machine Learning
I has Successfully completed Machine Learning course authorized by Stanford University and offer Through Coursera.I have also done  different courses from Udemy Some course base on Libraries Some base on theoratical and Some base on Practical which I have learn.After 2 years Experience I make a diferrent projects on Machine Learning taken dataset from different Sources like UCI, Kaggle, Reddit etc.I also done #100DaysMLCode Challenges.I also writing a blog on Machine Learning artices from Scratch on medium.I have a Publication  on Machine Learning base on Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm.Reference:'Performance Evaluation of Supervised Machine Learning Classifiers for Predicting Healthcare Operational Decisions'.

The following Project are:

## Regression

### Project 1: Match Score Prediction using Linear Regression
In this Project I take a dataset of Cricket Score from Cricinfo Website.The Dataset contains two attribute first attribute is Overs which is called X and Second attribute is Score which is called Y and dataset contain 20 instances mean 20 overs dataset and I Use a Simple Linear Regression Algorithm to predict the Score of 20th overs using the Scikit Learn Library.Basically I use 80% data for training and 20% for Testing Base on Testing I make a prediction of Score.

### Project 2: Heart Rate of Rabbits Prediction using Decision Tree Regression
In this Project I take a dataset of Heart rate baroreflexes for rabbits from Reddit Website.The dataset contains measurements of mean arterial pressure (mmHG) and heart rate (b/min) for a baroreflex curve.A data frame with 18 observations on the following 2 variables.first attribute is 'pressure' a numeric vector containing measurements of arterial pressure.Second Attribute is 'rate'a numeric vector containing measurements of heart rate. I Use a Decision Tree Regression Algorithm to predict the Heart Rate of Rabbits using the Scikit Learn Library.Basically I use 80% data for training and 20% for Testing Base on Testing I make a prediction of Heart Rate of Rabbits.

### Project 3: Monthly Access Return Challenge Using the Random Forrest Regression
In this Project I take a dataset of Monthly Access from Github/Rdatasets.The dataset contains 60 rows and 3 columns.The excess return for the Acme Cleveland Corporation are recorded along with those for all stocks listed on the New York and American Stock Exchanges were recorded over a five year period. These excess returns are relative to the return on a risk-less investment such a U.S. Treasury bills.This data frame contains the following columns:'month'A character string representing the month of the observation.'market'The excess return of the market as a whole.'acme'The excess return for the Acme Cleveland Corporation.I Use a Random Forrest Regression Technique to predict acme using the Scikit Learn Library.Basically I use 80% data for training and 20% for Testing Base on Testing I make a prediction of acme.
