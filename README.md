### Project 1 : Linear Regression
#### Match Score Prediction
In this Project I take a dataset of Cricket Score from Cricinfo Website.The Dataset contains two attribute first attribute is Overs which is called X and Second attribute is Score which is called Y and dataset contain 20 instances mean 20 overs dataset and I Use a Simple Linear Regression Algorithm to predict the Score of 20th overs using the Scikit Learn Library.Basically I use 80% data for training and 20% for Testing Base on Testing I make a prediction of Score.
