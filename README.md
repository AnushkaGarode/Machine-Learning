# Machine Learning
In this repository, I upload my Complete Machine Learning code which I have learned from different courses(Coursera, udemy, edx, udacity), different websites blogs, different tutorials from YouTube, books, and research papers. I have covered both Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms with Practical Implementation.

###### These are following Projects that I have done in Machine Learning
  
 ## <------------------------------Supervised Learning ---------------------------->

## Regression

### Project 1: Match Score Prediction using Linear Regression
In this project, I take a dataset of the Cricket Score from Cricinfo Website. The Dataset contains two attributes the first attribute is Overs which is called X and the Second attribute is Score which is called Y and the dataset contains 20 instances mean 20 overs dataset and I Use a Simple Linear Regression Algorithm to predict the Score of 20th overs using the Scikit Learn Library. Basically, I use 80% data for training and 20% for Testing Base on Testing I make a prediction of Score.

### Project 2: Heart Rate of Rabbits Prediction using Decision Tree Regression
In this project, I take a dataset of Heart rate baroreflexes for rabbits from Reddit Website. The dataset contains measurements of mean arterial pressure (mmHg) and heart rate (b/min) for a baroreflex curve. A data frame with 18 observations on the following 2 variables.first attribute is 'pressure' a numeric vector containing measurements of arterial pressure. The second Attribute is 'rate' a numeric vector containing measurements of heart rate. I Use a Decision Tree Regression Algorithm to predict the Heart Rate of Rabbits using the Scikit Learn Library. Basically, I use 80% data for training and 20% for Testing Base on Testing I make a prediction of Heart Rate of Rabbits.

### Project 3: Monthly Access Return Challenge Using the Random Forrest Regression
In this project, I take a dataset of Monthly Access from Github/R datasets. The dataset contains 60 rows and 3 columns. The excess return for the Acme Cleveland Corporation are recorded along with those for all stocks listed on the New York and American Stock Exchanges were recorded over a five year period. These excess returns are relative to the return on a risk-less investment such a U.S. Treasury bills. This data frame contains the following columns: 'month character string representing the month of the observation.' market's excess return of the market as a whole.' acme' The excess return for the Acme Cleveland Corporation. I Use a Random Forrest Regression Technique to predict acme using the Scikit Learn Library. Basically, I use 80% data for training and 20% for Testing Base on Testing I make a prediction of acme.

### Project 4: Delay in AIDS Reporting prediction using Support Vector Machine Regression
In this project, I take a dataset of Delay in AIDS Reporting in England and Wales from Github/R datasets. The dataset contains The aids data frame has 570 rows and 6 columns. Although all cases of AIDS in England and Wales must be reported to the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, there is often a considerable delay between the time of diagnosis and the time that it is reported. In estimating the prevalence of AIDS, the account must be taken of the unknown number of cases that have been diagnosed but not reported. The data set here records the reported cases of AIDS diagnosed from July 1983 and until the end of 1992. The data are cross-classified by the date of diagnosis and the time delay in the reporting of the cases. This data frame contains the following columns: the year of the diagnosis.' quarter's quarter of the year in which diagnosis was made.' delay' The time delay (in months) between diagnosis and reporting. 0 means that the case was reported within one month. Longer delays are grouped in 3-month intervals and the value of delay is the midpoint of the interval (therefore a value of 2 indicates that reporting was delayed for between 1 and 3 months).'dud'An indicator of censoring. These are categories for which full information is not yet available and the number recorded is a lower bound only.' time'
The time interval of the diagnosis. That is the number of quarters from July 1983 until the end of the quarter in which these cases were diagnosed and 'y' The number of AIDS cases reported. I Use an SVM  Regression Technique to predict Aid using the Scikit Learn Library. Basically, I use 80% data for training and 20% for Testing Base on Testing I make a prediction of Aids Report.
