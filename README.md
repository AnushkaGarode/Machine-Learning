### Project 4: Delay in AIDS Reporting prediction using Support Vector Machine Regression
In this Project I take a dataset of Delay in AIDS Reporting in England and Wales from Github/Rdatasets.The dataset contains The aids data frame has 570 rows and 6 columns.Although all cases of AIDS in England and Wales must be reported to the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, there is often a considerable delay between the time of diagnosis and the time that it is reported. In estimating the prevalence of AIDS, account must be taken of the unknown number of cases which have been diagnosed but not reported. The data set here records the reported cases of AIDS diagnosed from July 1983 and until the end of 1992. The data are cross-classified by the date of diagnosis and the time delay in the reporting of the cases.This data frame contains the following columns:'year'The year of the diagnosis.'quarter'The quarter of the year in which diagnosis was made.'delay'The time delay (in months) between diagnosis and reporting. 0 means that the case was reported within one month. Longer delays are grouped in 3 month intervals and the value of delay is the midpoint of the interval (therefore a value of 2 indicates that reporting was delayed for between 1 and 3 months).'dud'An indicator of censoring. These are categories for which full information is not yet available and the number recorded is a lower bound only.'time'
The time interval of the diagnosis. That is the number of quarters from July 1983 until the end of the quarter in which these cases were diagnosed and 'y'The number of AIDS cases reported.I Use a SVM  Regression Technique to predict Aid using the Scikit Learn Library.Basically I use 80% data for training and 20% for Testing Base on Testing I make a prediction of Aids Report.

### Project 6: Email Spam Filtering Using the Decsion Tree Classifier
In this Project I take a dataset of  Email Spam Filtering from UCI Repository.The data consist of 4601 email items, of which 1813 items were identified as spam.This data frame contains the following columns:"crl.tot":total length of words in capitals."dollar":number of occurrences of the \$ symbol."bang":number of occurrences of the ! symbol."money":number of occurrences of the word ‘money’.

### Project 8: Iris dataset prediction Using the k-Nearest Neighbors(kNN)
In this Project I take a dataset of Social_Network_Ads from UCI Repository.This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. (See Duda & Hart, for example.) The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other. Predicted attribute: class of iris plant.Attribute Information:1. sepal length in cm 2. sepal width in cm 3. petal length in cm 4. petal width in cm 5. class: -- Iris Setosa -- Iris Versicolour -- Iris Virginica.I Use a k-Nearest Neighbors Technique to predict class of iris plant using the Scikit Learn Library.Basically I use 80% data for training and 20% for Testing Base on Testing I make a prediction of class of iris plant which gave the accuracy 86.66%.

### Project 9: Breast Cancer Coimbra Dataset (UCI) prediction using Logistic Regression
In this Project I take a dataset of Breast Cancer Coimbra from UCI Repository.There are 10 predictors, all quantitative, and a binary dependent variable, indicating the presence or absence of breast cancer.The predictors are anthropometric data and parameters which can be gathered in routine blood analysis. Prediction models based on these predictors, if accurate, can potentially be used as a biomarker of breast cancer.Attribute Information:Quantitative Attributes: Age (years),BMI (kg/m2) , Glucose (mg/dL) ,Insulin (µU/mL) , HOMA ,Leptin (ng/mL) ,Adiponectin (µg/mL) ,Resistin (ng/mL) ,MCP-1(pg/dL) , Labels: 1=Healthy controls ,2=Patients.I Use a Logistic Regression Technique to predict the classification attribute Labels: 1=Healthy controls ,2=Patients using the Scikit Learn Library.Basically I use 80% data for training and 20% for Testing Base on Testing I make a prediction of classification attribute Labels: 1=Healthy controls ,2=Patients which gave the accuracy 62.50%.

### Project 10: Blood Transfusion DataSet(UCI) prediction using SVM Classifier
In this Project I take a dataset of Blood Transfusion Service Center from UCI Repository.To demonstrate the RFMTC marketing model (a modified version of RFM), this study adopted the donor database of Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City in Taiwan. The center passes their blood transfusion service bus to one university in Hsin-Chu City to gather blood donated about every three months. To build a FRMTC model, we selected 748 donors at random from the donor database. These 748 donor data, each one included R (Recency - months since last donation), F (Frequency - total number of donation), M (Monetary - total blood donated in c.c.), T (Time - months since first donation), and a binary variable representing whether he/she donated blood in March 2007 (1 stand for donating blood; 0 stands for not donating blood).I Use a Support Vector Machine Classifier approach to predict class(1 stand for donating blood; 0 stands for not donating blood) using the Scikit Learn Library.Basically I use 80% data for training and 20% for Testing Base on Testing I make a prediction of class(1 stand for donating blood; 0 stands for not donating blood)of which gave the accuracy 72.66%.
